It contains repeated segments to simulate realistic verbose threat intelligence attachment blocks. [SEG-A-BEGIN] The threat was part of a coordinated multi-vector campaign observed across various geographic regions targeting enterprise networks with spear-phishing, watering-hole attacks, and supply-chain compromise vectors. Enriched indicators include C2 domains, malware families, behavioral clusters, sandbox detonation traces, and network telemetry correlation. [SEG-A-END] [SEG-B-BEGIN] Further analysis revealed that the payload exhibited persistence techniques including registry autoruns, scheduled tasks, masquerading, process injection, and lateral movement attempts leveraging remote service creation and stolen credentials. The binary contains multiple obfuscation layers, anti-debugging, anti-VM checks, and unusual API call sequences.
